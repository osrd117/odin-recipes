    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. 
        I prefer to cook these outdoors â€” they grill up very fast because of 
        the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 (6-inch) squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.</li>
        <li>If you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.</li>
        <li>You can make 4 (4-ounce) patties instead of 8 (2-ounce patties), but I prefer the thinner patties that have a more crispy surface area.</li>
        <li>I buy American cheese freshly sliced from the deli, but individually wrapped slices will work, too.</li>
    </ul>
