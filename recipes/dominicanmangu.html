    <h2>How to Make a Smash Burger</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the plantains and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook 20 minutes, 
            until plantains are tender but slightly firm. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the liquid. 
            Cool plantains, and peel.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender.</li>
        <li>Form the meat into loosely-packed balls.</li>
        <li>Place each ball on the grill, cover with a piece of parchment, and smash.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mash the plantains with the reserved liquid and salt. Transfer to a 
            food processor, mix in the peppers, and puree. Serve the pureed plantain mixture 
            topped with the onions.</li>
