    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This New York cheesecake is dense and rich. It includes a great 
        technique for letting the cheesecake finish in the oven so that 
        no cracks form as the cake cools. It's a favorite dessert of 
        mine served with my fresh strawberry sauce.

    <h2>How to Make New York-Style Cheesecake</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the crust and press it into a prepared springform pan.</li>
        <li>Make the filling and pour it over the crust.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges are puffed and the center is slightly jiggly. </li>
        <li>Let the cheesecake cool in the oven. </li>
    </li>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the 
           bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until 
           evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2
           inch up the sides of the springform pan.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; 
            set aside.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a 
           separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add 
           milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a 
           time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, 
           orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just 
           incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely 
           puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for 
           a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is 
           gently shaken, about 1 hour.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it 
           cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks 
           from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</p>
